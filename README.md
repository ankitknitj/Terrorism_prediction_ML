# Terrorism_prediction_ML
In this repository, Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is used to classify the Terrorist Group which might be involved in an attack based on number of kills, region, weapons used etc.

The repository contains a jupyter notebook, which is used to preprocess the data and classify the Terrorist Groups using Machine Learning techniques like Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree with accuracies of 96.55% and 98.27% respectively.

The input and labels of the model are stored in the x_normed.npy and y.npy files respectively.
